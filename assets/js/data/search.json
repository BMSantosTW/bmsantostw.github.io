The cross-stitcher will know any terminology specific to cross-stitching and will be able to follow basic instructions in navigating computer programs. When followed correctly, these instructions will inform the reader how to convert an image to a full-coverage cross-stitch pattern.Many cross-stitchers who are familiar with modern trends in cross-stitching also know about full coverage patterns. Some cross-stitchers want to make full-coverage patterns from artwork or photography but don’t know how or don’t have the time. Computer programs such as WinStitch can convert photographs and artwork into these patterns, but the results can look subpar at times. Using basic skills in Photoshop and WinStitch, you can prepare and make professional-looking patterns!PrerequisitesYou will need the following: Prerequisite Description Computer, mouse, and keyboard Must meet the minimum hardware requirements for WinStitch and Photoshop. WinStitch Install and use the latest version. Adobe Photoshop Install and use the latest version. Previous versions of Photoshop, such as Adobe Photoshop CS6, may be used instead if they have the Adjustment Layers function. An image file Use artwork or photography that you have created, or have permission to use, especially if you are making the pattern for commercial purposes. Note: Other image editing software, such as Paint.NET or GIMP, can be used instead of Photoshop, as they have similar capabilities, but instructions for using those programs are beyond the purview of this tutorial.Image Preparation in PhotoshopWinStitch’s conversion feature works well with a variety of mediums. However, it typically works best with an image file that has a limited color range due to the limited number of colors available in embroidery floss. The following procedure in Photoshop ensures a picture is prepared for conversion.Resizing Your ImageBefore you can begin reducing colors, you need to reduce or enlarge your image to the final size of the pattern. Make or find an image file (such as scanned artwork, a digital painting, or a photo) you want to convert into a pattern. The example image used for this guide is Edmund Leighton’s 1901 painting, The Accolade, a public-domain painting sourced from Wikimedia Commons. Open Photoshop. Using the menu, click Open…, then navigate to your image file in the explorer window. Select Open in the dialog box to open your image file. Using the menu, click Image &amp;gt; Image Size. Doing so brings up the Image Size dialog box, where you can adjust the size of the image (see Figure 1). Figure 1. The Image Size dialog box, demonstrating the unit drop-down menu. Click the unit of measure next to Width or Height, which is likely set either to Pixels or Inches, to open the drop-down menu. Set the unit of measure to Inches. Adjust the picture to your desired size by typing your values into the Width and Height fields. Note: Larger pictures result in larger canvases with plenty of room for details, so make sure your image file is bigger than about 15 inches wide and tall if you want WinStitch’s conversion to preserve as much detail as possible from the original file. Click OK.Posterizing the ImageNow that the picture is the desired size, we must limit the color palette. One of the easiest ways to do this in Photoshop is to use a Posterize adjustment layer: Using the menu, select Layer &amp;gt; New Adjustment Layer &amp;gt; Posterize. Click OK on the New Layer dialog box. Doing so will bring up a new window in the right-hand pane of Photoshop above the Layers window called Properties (see Figure 2). Figure 2. The Properties window associated with the Posterize adjustment layer. Type a value in the field by Levels. The lower the value, the fewer colors the image has. Choose a value that gives you the best-looking picture. Note: The image will show your changes in real time, allowing you to adjust the image freely. Start at 2 and go up from there until you are satisfied. From the menu, select File &amp;gt; Save As, then name the file a name you can find later. Select PNG from the drop-down menu, then click Save.Conversion in WinStitchNow that the image is ready, we can move on to using WinStitch.Importing the FileWinStitch has an automatic image import wizard, but we can get better results using the Advanced Image Import tool. Open WinStitch. Select the Convert Image button in the left-hand menu. Select Advanced Image Import. Navigate to your prepared image file in the explorer window, then click the Open button.The Import a Picture dialog box will appear (see Figure 3). Chart Width determines the width of the pattern, and the value of Stitches/in determines the pattern’s fabric count. Underneath the sliding arrows next to Chart Width are a set of values; this is the size of the pattern WinStitch has automatically suggested. Figure 3. The Import a Picture dialog box. Select the small arrows next to Stitches/in and set the fabric count to your desired fabric count. Note: The higher the fabric count, the more detail WinStitch will preserve in the conversion process. Most full-coverage patterns from designers like Heaven and Earth Designs use 24ct fabric. Select the box in the middle of the arrows next to Chart Width and slide it left or right until the values beneath the image correspond to the actual size of your image as you made it in Photoshop. The example image was resized to 15 inches wide and 25 inches tall in Photoshop, so set it to the same size in WinStitch. Select DMC.threads from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the dialog box. Click OK. Doing so will bring up a new WinStitch pattern creation window showing your imported pattern (see Figure 4). Figure 4. The pattern creation window. Finalizing the PatternOnce the new window is displayed, it’s time to review the pattern and export it for printing. Select the Grid button in the second toolbar from the top of the window. Select Grid Visible. This will turn the gridlines off and allow you to see your created pattern. Click the Zoom button (represented by a magnifying glass icon) in the bottom-right corner, then click any value you wish to preview your pattern. Once you are satisfied with the pattern, select Import/Export from the menu. Select Export to PDF for Pattern Keeper. Click OK on the dialog box, then name your new pattern chart.TroubleshootingThe conversion process outlined here isn’t always perfect. Here are some suggestions for common issues: Are there lots of pure black dots in not-so-dark shaded areas? Is the image too washed out? Use a Brightness/Contrast adjustment layer in Photoshop to increase the brightness of the image a little or adjust the contrast. Does the pattern look too pixelated? Either increase the levels in the Posterize adjustment layer in Photoshop or skip that step entirely. Are the colors on the screen too bright or too dull? Use a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer in Photoshop to correct the saturation levels.

The goal of this document is to teach someone who has no website development knowledge how to set up a basic WordPress website.If you need a simple website solution, you might already know about WordPress. 39.6% of websites on the Internet use WordPress as a content management system (CMS)1. A good CMS is vital for establishing a website that uses modern website design principle and empowers anyone to build websites without a technical background. It’s no surprise that WordPress, renowned for its flexibility and accessibility, is widely used for websites of all purposes. Anything from shopping platforms to simple blogs is possible with WordPress.Getting StartedThe first step to setting up a WordPress website is to find a web host that offers WordPress installation packages. Web hosts are service providers that provide server space to host a website. Contrary to what you may assume, web hosts services also don’t have to cost money just to start a website. There are many web hosts, both free and paid, that may suit your needs.However, it can be overwhelming to look at web hosts, especially if you don’t know what you need from one. Let’s go over some of the main factors to look for when choosing a web host for a WordPress website.BandwidthBandwidth is the measure of how much traffic your website is getting, or more accurately, a measurement of how much data a server is having to send back and forth whenever someone views a web page hosted on their server. Most free web hosts and some paid web hosts cap how much bandwidth your website can generate. If you’ve seen a website go viral online (e.g., a popular Reddit post links to a small blog webpage) and the website goes down later with an Error 509: Bandwidth Exceeded page, that is why.Be realistic about your bandwidth needs. For instance, if you want to start a blog and don’t have a large following from elsewhere, you might not need a lot of bandwidth immediately. If you’re building a website for a business, however, you would want your web page to be viewable by anyone at any time. A website that’s down due to exceeding bandwidth limits can look embarrassing, especially if it happens while someone is trying to research your business to see if it suits their needs.Disk SpaceDisk space refers to how much data your website occupies on the web host’s server(s). The file sizes of all the images on your websites, as well as any other assets, will add up to occupy disk space, just like on your computer’s hard drive. If you have many images, videos, and sound files as assets on your website, you will need a web host service that will have enough disk space for your website. If you do not plan to use many assets on your websites, disk space should not be as important in your search for a web host.Price of Hosting and Other CostsOf course, the price of web hosting is a huge factor in considering a web host for many individuals and small businesses. There are two major categories for web hosts: free web hosts and paid web hosts.Free HostingFree web hosts are a viable option for many people who do not want to spend a lot of money on hosting services. Many websites do not generate direct revenue (e.g., through a shopping platform or advertising). However, many free web hosts put advertising or other mandatory banners onto your web pages which may look unprofessional to your audience.Free web hosts also tend to have lower bandwidth and disk space limits. These limits are problematic for websites that receive heavy traffic and use large asset files. Free web hosts also do not come with free domain names, so you would have to pay for a domain name separately or use a subdomain of one of the host’s domains instead (e.g., Bob chooses to host his bakery website at a web host called Freehost.com without a domain name, so his URL might be https://www.bobsbakery.freehost.com).Paid HostingPaid hosting refers to a web host that charges money for their web hosting services, typically in different plans of varying costs. Many paid web host services come with a free domain name of your choice, which is the expected norm for any website intended for a business (e.g., Bob’s Bakery might have a website called https://www.bobsbakery.com).Should you have the budget for a paid web host, be aware that many web hosts advertise a monthly price billed as one annual price, which means you pay a large sum up-front for an entire year’s service. Actual monthly bill plans are often more expensive in the long run compared to the advertised yearly cost, but if you are uncertain about how long you will need the website and you don’t want to spend a lot of money, an actual monthly bill plan might be the best option.Other CostsPlugins and themes are other things to consider when looking at the overall cost of hosting a WordPress website. Plugins are add-ons to the WordPress software that add extra functionality to your website, such as a shopping platform or an anti-spam filter for the comments section on your blog pages. Themes are the ‘skin,’ or the overall look, of your website. While many plugins and themes are freely available, some plugins and themes may cost money to acquire and set up on your WordPress website.Installing and Configuring WordPressOnce you have selected a web host, the next step is to install WordPress onto your website. The cPanel software web hosts commonly use to install a CMS like WordPress may look different from service to service. However, the general flow of actions should be consistent across web hosts, and many web host services have more specific guides tailored to their user interfaces for installing WordPress. Namecheap’s web hosting service is used here as the model for this list of instructions. Log into your web host’s cPanel. Locate your web host’s WordPress package and click on it (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Software installation packages available to install from Namecheap&#39;s cPanel. Click the Install button. This will bring you to the installation window (see Figure 2). Figure 2. The installation window. Fill the Admin Username, Admin Password, and Admin E-mail fields with your information. Caution: Use a secure and unique password and a unique admin username to prevent security issues. Scroll down to find and click the Install button. Wait for the installation process to finish.Once the installation process is complete, you will receive an administrative URL to interact with your new website’s Dashboard, which handles the backend of your website. This administrative URL usually is in the form of a URL with /wp-admin/ after your domain name, e.g., Bob’s Bakery has a WordPress website with a URL of https://www.bobsbakery.com, and the administrative URL is https://www.bobsbakery.com/wp-admin/.Setting the Site Title and TaglineNow that your WordPress software has finished installing, it’s time to edit your new website to look the way you want it to look. The first thing to do is to set the title and tagline of your new website, which will show up on every page you create. Log into your WordPress Dashboard using the administrative URL and the username and password you set previously in the installation process. Scroll down to Settings on the left-hand bar, then click General from the drop-down menu to access General Settings (see Figure 3). Figure 3. The general settings. Fill in the Site Title and Tagline. Scroll down the page to find the Save Changes button, then click it.Changing ThemesOnce you have finished setting a title and tagline for your website, it’s time for the most crucial part of your website’s aesthetic: choosing a theme. Themes can radically transform a WordPress website to look less like a blog and resemble a slick and modern shopping platform or a clean portfolio website. Themes are downloaded and installed from WordPress’s official theme archive, but there’s a quick and easy way to do it from your WordPress Dashboard: Scroll to Appearance on the left-hand bar, then click Themes from the drop-down menu. Click the Add New button next to the Themes header. Browse through the themes available to you in the Add Themes window (see Figure 4). Once you find one you want to install, hover over the theme’s preview window and click Install. Figure 4. The Add Themes window. Click the Activate button. Note: Depending on the theme you installed, you may have additional prompts to install other configurations to achieve the theme developer’s intended look. Type the URL for your website into your browser to see your website’s new theme.Installing PluginsPlugins are valuable additions to a WordPress website, such as adding automatic spam filters to reduce spam comments on your blog posts. Like themes, plugins are typically downloaded and installed from WordPress’s official plugin archive, but they can be downloaded and installed right from your WordPress dashboard: Scroll to Plugins on the left-hand bar, then click Add New from the drop-down menu. Browse through the plugins available to you in the Add Plugins screen (see Figure 5). Once you find one you want to install, click the Install Now button next to the plugin’s name. Figure 5. The Add Plugins window. Find and click Installed Plugins on the left-hand bar underneath Plugins. Find your newly installed plugin in the list of installed plugins. Click Activate under the name of the plugin. Note: Depending on the plugin you installed, you may have additional prompts or a wizard to go through to finish activating the plugin. Adding a New PagePages make up the bulk of a non-blog WordPress website. Recent versions of WordPress use a block system to make adding pages easy for WordPress beginners. This document is a quick start guide, so the block system isn’t fully documented here, but the very basics of publishing a new page are as follows: Scroll to Pages on the left-hand bar, then click Add New from the drop-down menu. You will now see the Page editor (Figure 6). Figure 6. The Page Editor. Click on Add Title and fill in your page title. Click on Type / to choose a block and fill in your content. Note: Click the Save Draft button in the top-right corner of the screen to save your progress whenever you edit a page. Click the Publish button in the top-right corner of the screen to publish your page once you are satisfied.References Galov, Nick. “35+ WordPress Statistics for the Budding Webmaster,” Hosting Tribunal, 09 August 2021.

According to a survey conducted by the meal planning app eMeals, consumers went from cooking dinner 3.8 times a week to as many as six times a week at home in the wake of the pandemic 1. Beyond the pandemic, however, these apps still have a place in everyday life. Meal planning apps take the stress out of meal preparation for busy adults who want to spend less on takeout or eat better. Their algorithms pull from a database of recipes and present a nutritionally balanced meal plan each week for any household shape and size. However, one app may be better suited for one person than another due to the following:• Price• Dietary restrictions or specialty diet accommodation• Menu customization• Grocery pickup and delivery app integrationThis report will compare two of the most popular meal planning apps: eMeals and PlateJoy. For this report, I tested the Android version of the apps.App DescriptionsBoth eMeals and PlateJoy are apps available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. eMeals started as a website-only service in 2003, transforming into a hybrid web service model with a focus on the mobile app side. PlateJoy launched in 2012 as a similar hybrid model.eMeals. Dinner is the core of eMeals’ offerings, and the most basic plan reflects that fact as the most inexpensive plan gives access only to dinner plans. A customer can add breakfast and lunch plans at an additional cost. Several different meal plans are available for the dinner plan, ranging from dietary restrictions or specialty diets (such as vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean, or keto) to more broad categories (such as kid-friendly meals, budget-friendly meals, or 30-minute meals). A customer cannot mix and match recipes from different meal plans, however, and there’s only one set meal plan for breakfasts and lunches.PlateJoy. PlateJoy offers a complete meal plan solution, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. As a result, it’s impossible to pay only for dinner recipes to save on money if you wanted only dinner recipes. PlateJoy’s appeal is its deep menu personalization based on a quiz that a customer can retake at any time for any member of the household. These questions include health goals, dietary restrictions or plans, types of food not wanted in recipes, and even specialty cooking equipment (such as if a customer has a slow cooker).ComparisonseMeals and PlateJoy will be compared according to (1) price, (2) dietary restrictions or specialty diet accommodations, (3) menu customization and flexibility, and (4) grocery pickup and delivery app integration.Price. According to PlateJoy’s website, a 6-month subscription, which gives access to every feature within the app and a complete daily menu, is $69.99, and a 12-month subscription is $99.99 2. Buying a 12-month subscription is the best value if the customer is willing to make a longer-term commitment. eMeals’ pricing is more complicated, as eMeals’ most basic dinner plan is $29.99 for a 3-month subscription and $69.99 for a 12-month subscription. Still, if a customer wants to add on lunch and breakfast, eMeals offers a complete bundle that costs $39.99 for a 3-month subscription and $99.98 for a 12-month subscription 3. The annual bundle for eMeals the cheapest option over time of the app’s purchases, and eMeals’ complete bundle is one cent more affordable than PlateJoy’s 12-month subscription that offers the same number of meals.Dietary restrictions or specialty diet accommodations. eMeals develops various weekly meal plans to accommodate different diets, such as vegan, vegetarian, keto, gluten-free, or Mediterranean diets. However, I found no way to adapt any of these plans for allergens, which can be problematic (for example, many vegan recipes use nut or soy-based alternatives for cheese and milk). The only solution for one or two bad recipes is to look at one of the other plans and switch to it for a week, which can be insufficient depending on the customer’s dietary restrictions. In contrast, PlateJoy’s personalized menu approach allows the customer to input all dietary restrictions and allergens without issue.Menu customization and flexibility. A typical customer gripe with meal planning apps is that a particular recipe generated by the app isn’t something that someone in the household will eat. Or perhaps a customer wants a recipe from a previous week in their current menu—can that be accommodated? Just as eMeals doesn’t have recipe adaptation for dietary restrictions and allergens outside of what’s already in their meal plans, I found no way during testing to request a different recipe for the week other than to switch to another meal plan for the week’s meals. A customer can look up past recipes in the eMeals app, but that’s the extent of eMeals’ flexibility. On the other hand, PlateJoy allows a customer to look up recipes by ingredients, such as ingredients already on hand, add to the menu, and delete a recipe from the menu.Grocery pickup and delivery app integration. Food planning apps often offer integration with grocery pickup and delivery apps, such as Instacart or Amazon Fresh, allowing customers to send their weekly meal plan to a local grocery store for a streamlined pickup or delivery process. PlateJoy’s app integrates with Instacart and Amazon Fresh, while Instacart can deliver from many grocery stores even if they are not listed explicitly as a partner with PlateJoy 4. eMeals’ app integration includes explicit partnerships with Albertson’s, Amazon Fresh, H-E-B, Instacart, Kroger, Safeway, Shipt, and Walmart Grocery 5. In my testing, I found that relying on Instacart to deliver from grocery stores can result in missing items, as Instacart is a third-party app whose contractors may not necessarily be familiar with a customer’s preferred store. Amazon Fresh is also not widely available everywhere, so eMeals has a better range of partnerships.SummaryThe following is a summary of the comparison of eMeals and PlateJoy. Both apps are capable of meal planning. eMeals is the most inexpensive option if used only for dinners. eMeals and PlateJoy are almost tied (by one cent) for the lowest cost option if used for all meals. PlateJoy can adjust menus for dietary restrictions and allergies. PlateJoy can customize menus by recipe lookup and menu editing. eMeals has the best integration for grocery and delivery apps. PlateJoy is the best overall meal planning app.Table 1. Testing results of eMeals and PlateJoy.
